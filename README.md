# VIMP

## ...What?

- Vim + GIMP = VIMP (it's not that hard)
- Combine Vim's shortcuts with the capabilities of an image editor,
  and you've got yourself the ultimate sketch program (no drawing pad needed ðŸ˜‰)

## Ok, but why?

- Don't you hate using *traditional* (that means old and broken) image editors,
    like MS Paint?!
- ***VIMP*** is the solution to all your quick image editing needs

## Really?

- Written in Rust/Leptos <=> BLAZINGALY FAST!!
- Easy Command Syntax (to those already familiar with Vim)
- Renders images using SVG (which is cool afaik)
